BSD pidfile for Rust
====================

This crate provides a wrapper for a family of [`pidfile_*` functions][pidfile] provided in the BSD systems by [libutil][], and elsewhere by [libbsd][].

Known alternatives in pure Rust:

 * [pidfile](https://crates.io/crates/pidfile) by Carl Lerche, very advanced, but last updated in 2014 and no longer compiles with modern Rust.
 * [pidlock](https://crates.io/crates/pidlock) by Paul Hummer provides a lock-like API, but doesn’t actually use filesystem locks.
 * [qpidfile](https://crates.io/crates/qpidfile) by Jan Danielsson, well-maintained, but very basic.

The BSD pidfile functions employ very clever locking mechanism, detect concurrently running daemons and allow deferring writes to the PID file, so potential errors can be handled before a fork.

The ultimate goal is to rewrite these functions in Rust, but until a rewrite is done, it’s best to use the BSD functions using the FFI.
